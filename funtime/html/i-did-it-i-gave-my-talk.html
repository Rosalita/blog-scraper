<p>This is a follow up on <a href="http://testingfuntime.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/learning-to-talk-finding-your-voice-and.html"> my earlier post </a> about learning how to give a technical talk.</p>

<p>I did it! I gave my talk! The feeling of euphoria afterwards was overwhelming and I think I might still be buzzing from the experience.</p>

<p>I wanted to write a mini blog post to say a massive THANKYOU to everyone that came along to the Newcastle Testing meet up on 1st November. It was good to see a mix of both familiar and new faces. Also thank you to Russell & David for organising the evening and thank you to sponsor <a href="http://www.sage.co.uk">Sage</a> for providing a steady supply of beer and pizza.</p>


<p>There are a couple of links I would like to share.</p>

<p> Firstly, for anyone interested in attending the Newcastle testing meet up, full details of future meetings can be found at:<br>

<p>Secondly, for anyone that was unable to make the event, I have managed to get my talk & slides uploaded to Youtube here:<br>

<h1>Retrospective Thoughts</h1>

<p>It felt like the talk went better this time than the previous time I gave it. I know the free beer definitely helped suppress any feelings of anxiety and fear.</p>

<p>I feel exhausted from the journey public speaking has taken me on, but its been worth every moment. I need to take a rest but don't want to lose momentum so I have decided to set myself the following speaking goals for 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give a talk to a larger audience</li>
<li> Give a talk that isn't about testing </li>
<li> Give a lightning talk at a conference (probably a 99 second talk at a Test Bash event)</li>
</ul>

<p>Look forward to hopefully seeing you at the next meet up!</p>
